# BetBall 🎮  
A fun and interactive game platform built with React.js and Matter.js. The first game, **Pinball Challenge**, lets players compete by navigating their balls through a dynamic map filled with obstacles. The last ball to exit the map loses the game!  

## 🌟 Features  
- **Customizable Map**: Select different obstacle layouts.  
- **Player Interaction**: Add participants and shuffle their starting positions.  
- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Uses Matter.js for realistic ball movement and collisions.  
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Watch balls bounce and collide with various barriers.  

## 🚀 Demo  
Coming soon!  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Physics Engine**: Matter.js  
- **Styling**: CSS
